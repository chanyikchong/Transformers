# Transformers
Transformers is the state-of-art neural network on NLP. First introduce by Google's paper "Attention is all you need" in 2017. It can perform much better than RNN in many application such as machine translation. The code was implemented base on pytorch class Transformer. It's easy to understand the structure of the transformer and you can build your own transformer or apply it directly.
